# Guessing Number Game
#     The Number Guessing Game is a Python-based interactive game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen integer within a specified range. The game prompts the player to enter a lower and upper bound for the range of numbers. Based on these bounds, a random integer is generated. The player has a limited number of chances to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game provides feedback (too high, too low, or correct) until the player either guesses correctly or runs out of chances.
